<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Sydnee Martin. I currently reside in Winchester, VA with my family and my three-year-old pup named Harlow. I have a B.A. in American Studies from the George Washington University and currently in my final semester of graduate school at the University of Florida. In May 2025 I am set to receive my M.A. in Communications with a specialization in Global Strategic Communications.</p>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Traveled to over 20 countries.</li>
    <li>Self-published a book at 15.</li>
    <li>My dad is from Jamaica and we visit frequently.</li>
    <li>I am a first-time dog owner.</li>
    <li>I have a photography business on the side.</li>
    <li>I am soon to be a first-time homeowner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career Goals</h2>

<p>After graduate school I would like to utilize my degree and have my career focus on communications. Although, that is pretty vague at the moment, I'm hoping that I can use my graduate school experience in a field focused on urban community forestry or program management within my current job field.</p>
